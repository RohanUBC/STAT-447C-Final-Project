- **Course:** STAT 447C - Bayesian Statistics



### Project Theme and Overview

The aim of this project is to apply Bayesian forecasting techniques to model and 
predict unemployment rates in the United States (US), utlizing a real-world dataset
that has documented the monthly unemployment rate (from 01/1948 to 02/2024) in the 
US. Through the lens of Bayesian time series analysis, this project aims to reveal
seasonal patterns/fluctuations in the data, providing a detailed look at how the
unemployment rate has evolved over time, with a goal of providing probabilistic forecasts
of future trends. Furthermore, this project also aims to quantify the uncertainty
surrounding these forcasts, which is an important consideration to make when considering
the inherent variability over the years in the US labor market. 

This approach will enable a detailed assessment of the historical behavior of unemployment
rates, offering insights into the potential future state of the US labor market, 
solely based on its past trends. This analysis would hold significant value in understanding
US economic cycles, the planning of any governmental interventions, and for preparing
for future market conditions, while also showcasing how Bayesian methods can be applied
in economic time series forecasting.



### Data Sources

The two real-world candidate datasets that have been identified are:
 
**Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):** This dataset offer historical data on monthly 
US unemployment rates (from 1948 to 2024) and their associated economic indicators.

**US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):** Just like the dataset from the US Federal 
Reserve, his dataset offer historical data on monthly US unemployment rates (from 1948
to 2024) and their associated economic indicators.
