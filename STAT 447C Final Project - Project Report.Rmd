# Problem Formulation

- A real-world inference task/problem.
- Succinct but sufficient context (e.g. biological terminology) needed to understand
the problem.
- The key modelling/methodological/challenge, clearly associating it with one of 
the items under the "menu of project themes" above.
- Project Theme: Methodological/theoretical aspect of the project: Is the approach 
sound? Creative?

# Literature Review

- The report contains a literature review, where relevant literature is cited and
properly summarized.

# Data Analysis

- A Bayesian model is precisely described (e.g., using the ... ~ ... notation).
- Implementation code in the appendix (e.g., using Stan)
- Prior choice is motivated. If appropriate, several choices are compared or sensitivity
analysis is performed.
- Critical evaluation of the posterior approximation. An appropriate combination of
diagnostics, synthetic datasets and other validation strategies.
