### Problem Formulation

- *Real-world inference task/problem:* Forecasting future US unemployment rates based
on historical data (1948-2024) using HMM.
- *Context:* Briefly explain the significance of unemployment rates in economic planning
and policy-making.
- *Key modeling/methodological challenge:* Applying Bayesian time series analysis to
reveal seasonal patterns, understand historical trends, and provide probabilistic
forecasts of future unemployment rates. Also have a focus on calibration
- Note the importance of accurate uncertainty measures in forecasting.
