## Problem Formulation

The central focus of this project is to model and forecast unemployment rates in 
the United States (US), utilizing a real-world dataset that has documented the monthly
unemployment rate (from 01/1948 to 02/2024) in the US. A key element of the project 
is to accurately forecast these rates into the future while also quantifying the 
inherent uncertainty of such forecasts. The dataset that is being used is from the 
US Federal Reserve on monthly US unemployment rates.

*Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):* This dataset offer historical data on monthly 
US unemployment rates (from 1948 to 2024) and their associated economic indicators.

We will adopt a Bayesian time series analysis approach, utilizing a Bayesian Structural
Time Series (BSTS) model to capture the dynamics of the US labor market based on the
provided data. This involves uncovering and modeling historical trends and seasonal 
patterns within the data, providing probabilistic forecasts of future unemployment rates.
We opt for BSTS due to its flexibility in modeling complex time series data with trend
and seasonality components. BSTS allows for the estimation of latent states, such 
as trend and seasonal effects, and provides a framework for forecasting future states
while quantifying uncertainty. Please see Appendix C on a general overview on the
BSTS model.

**Key Modelling/Methodological Challenge**

This project faces challenges in applying Bayesian time series analysis with BSTS
to economic data, particularly in modeling the seasonal patterns and long-term trends
inherent in unemployment rates. The primary hurdle lies in selecting and fine-tuning
parameters and models that can accurately reflect the dynamics of the US labor market.
This includes determining appropriate prior distributions, specifying the structural
components of the model, and validating the model's performance through diagnostics
and posterior predictive checks. Additionally, handling the irregularity in seasonal
variation presents a challenge, requiring careful consideration in the modeling approach
to ensure accurate representation of the data. 

In addition, we aim to also include a calibration of the uncertainty of the forecast,
demanding a sophisticated approach in how the model is constructed and validated. 
This is done to ensure that the forecasts are not only precise, but also accompanied 
by reliable uncertainty measures. Such measures are pivotal for economic planning 
and policy-making, providing a foundation for risk-aware decision-making. By accurately
quantifying forecast uncertainty, this approach aims to assess potential risks effectively, 
thereby facilitating more informed and prudent economic decision making.

## Appendix A - Explanatory Data Analysis


**Reading in the Dataset**

```{r}

dat <- read_csv("UNRATE.csv")
dat$DATE <- as.Date(dat$DATE)
head(dat)

```


**Historical US Unemployment Rates from 01/1948 to 02/2024**

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}

plot(dat$DATE, dat$UNRATE, 
     type = "o",
     pch = 20, 
     col = "red", 
     xlab = "Date", 
     ylab = "Unemployment Rate (in %)",
     main = "Figure 1: Historical US Unemployment Rate Over Time")
lines(dat$DATE, dat$UNRATE, col = "black")

```


**Average Yearly US Unemployment Rates from 01/1948 to 02/2024**

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}

avg_yearly_unrate <- dat |>
  mutate(YEAR = format(DATE, "%Y")) |>  
  group_by(YEAR) |>  
  summarise(Average_Unemployment_Rate = mean(UNRATE, na.rm = TRUE)) 

avg_yearly_unrate$YEAR <- as.numeric(as.character(avg_yearly_unrate$YEAR))

plot(avg_yearly_unrate$YEAR, avg_yearly_unrate$Average_Unemployment_Rate,
     type = "o", 
     pch = 20,
     col = "red", 
     xlab = "Year", 
     ylab = "Average Unemployment Rate (in %)",
     main = "Figure 2: Average Yearly Unemployment Rate in the US")
lines(avg_yearly_unrate$YEAR, avg_yearly_unrate$Average_Unemployment_Rate, col = "black")

```

## Appendix B - Time Series Analysis


**Decomposition of the Time Series**

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6}

ts_unrate <- ts(dat$UNRATE, start = c(1948, 1), frequency = 12)
decompose_of_ts = stl(ts_unrate, s.window = "periodic")
plot(decompose_of_ts, 
     main = "Figure 3: Decomposition of the Time Series of US Unemployment Rates")

```

*Trend:* The trend plot in the decomposition suggests that there doesn't seem to
be any particular long-term trend in the US unemployment rates, however, there are
periods where the unemployment rate exhibits some trends, which seem to be non-linear
and varying with time.

*Seasonality:* The seasonal plot in the decomposition suggests that there is seasonal 
variation in the US unemployment rates, and there is a consistent interval in the
variation of the seasonality. The consistent interval in the seasonality suggests 
a stable seasonal effect that repeats annually.

*Remainder/Residual:* The remainder/residual plot of the decomposition appears to
be relatively small compared to the seasonal and trend components, suggesting that 
the model has captured most of the systematic structure in the data.

## Appendix C - General Overview on the Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) Model

The Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model is a statistical method that serves
several applications such as feature selection, time series forecasting, and causal 
inference analysis. It operates on time series data to ascertain underlying patterns
and forecast future data points.

BSTS models are composed of three primary elements:

1. *Kalman Filter:* A method for decomposing time series into components like trend
and seasonality, allowing state variables to be modeled dynamically over time.
2. *Spike-and-Slab Prior:* A technique for feature selection that identifies which 
predictors in a regression are most informative.
3. *Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA):* A process where multiple models are averaged 
together to produce predictions or infer parameters, accounting for model uncertainty. 
In the BSTS framework, BMA is utilized extensively to generate samples from repeated 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations into final model outputs, providing a 
comprehensive prediction that encompasses model variability.

A general BSTS model consists of two set of equations,

1. *Observational equation:* Response variable as a function of predictors and/or latent variables.
2. *State equations:* How the parameters evolve over the time.

BSTS models are usually implemented using the `bsts` package in R, but can also be
implemented using `rstan`. Stan's advanced MCMC algorithms enhance the flexibility 
and scalability of BSTS models, making it a powerful tool for time series analysis.
